how many of steps 1-6 you got completed
I have completed steps 1-6 with effiency and super awesome quality.


how you decided when it was appropriate to commit/push your changes
It was appropriate to commit/push my changes after I completed each step. In the assignment details it specifically says not to commit/push any micro-changes or every change all at once. 

how many commit/pushes you executed
I exectued commit/push 8 times. The first was "Add project files", the 2nd to 7th was the steps 1-6, and the final was the README.md file.

any specific troubles you had with GitHub or with completing the assignment
The only troubles I had was at the end when I was trying to find a different star image. They were either png's with the white background or with the tiled background. Some of them were also jpegs.
I eventually found one without one of those stupid backgrounds. I also had to change the size of the star dramatically so you could still somewhat see the background.

how you used AI, if you did
The little bit of AI that I used was for slightly increasing the height and width of the my background image as it was slightly too small when I put it in. Other than that, completing this assignment
was fairly simple as it was more or less repeating the same functions. (I am very thankful for this shaking off the monogame rust assignment)
